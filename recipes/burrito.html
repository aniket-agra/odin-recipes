        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Quick and easy, vegan bean and rice burritos are a perfect vegetarian dinner idea. 
            This basic recipe includes plenty of Mexican spices, is a great way to use up leftover rice, 
            and can be customized to whatever you have on hand. The secret to this delicious burrito is cilantro-lime rice. 
            Many restaurants rely on it for vegetarian burritos as well, and it's as simple as mixing chopped cilantro and 
            lime juice into cooked rice. You'll gently heat the rice then wrap it into a burrito with sautéed onion, garlic, 
            black or pinto beans, hot sauce, and a few spices. Add extra toppings such as non-dairy sour cream, 
            homemade guacamole, salsa, and black olives if you like.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>2 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or olive oil)</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can black beans (or pinto beans), drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch salt, to taste, optional</li>
            <li>4 (10-inch) large tortillas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, 
                toss together cooked rice and fresh
                 chopped cilantro, and drizzle with 
                 the lime juice. Heat in the microwave 
                 or on the stove just until hot, and 
                 give it a quick stir.</li>
            <li>In a separate large skillet, sauté the 
                onion in vegetable oil or olive oil for 
                5 minutes, or until the onion is soft. 
                Add the garlic and cook another minute.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the 
                black beans or pinto beans, and season 
                with the chili powder, cumin, and hot 
                sauce, stirring to combine. You can add 
                a bit of salt if you'd like, but you shouldn't 
                need too much with all the other seasonings. 
                Allow the beans to cook until heated through, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon the cilantro-lime rice and the black bean 
                mixture onto lightly warmed flour tortillas, and 
                add any additional toppings you want.</li>
            <li>Wrap the burritos.</li>
            <li>Cut in half and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
