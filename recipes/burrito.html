        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Quick and easy, vegan bean and rice burritos are a perfect vegetarian dinner idea. 
            This basic recipe includes plenty of Mexican spices, is a great way to use up leftover rice, 
            and can be customized to whatever you have on hand. The secret to this delicious burrito is cilantro-lime rice. 
            Many restaurants rely on it for vegetarian burritos as well, and it's as simple as mixing chopped cilantro and 
            lime juice into cooked rice. You'll gently heat the rice then wrap it into a burrito with saut√©ed onion, garlic, 
            black or pinto beans, hot sauce, and a few spices. Add extra toppings such as non-dairy sour cream, 
            homemade guacamole, salsa, and black olives if you like.</p>
